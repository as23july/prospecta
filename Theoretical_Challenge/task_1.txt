1. Read the input CSV file using the csv module in Python. This allows for easy parsing of the CSV data into rows and cells.

2. Iterate through each row and cell of the input CSV data. For each cell, check if it starts with the '=' sign, which indicates that it is a formula.

3. If the cell is a formula, use the appropriate logic to evaluate the formula and calculate the result. You can use the eval() function or a library like pandas to handle the formula.

4. If the cell is not a formula, add the original cell value to the output row.

5. Write the output row to the output CSV file using the csv module.

6. Repeat the process for all the rows in the input CSV file.

7. Close the input and output CSV files.
